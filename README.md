# Academic Issue tracking-system
A project used for tracking, monitoring and solving academic issues
Proposal for Academic Issue Tracking System (AITS) for Makerere University
Introduction
In today's academic environment at our mighty University Makerere, students often face challenges related to their academic records, including missing marks, unaddressed queries, and inadequate communication with their respective faculties. Currently, there is no centralized system for students to report these issues, leading to frustration and delays in resolution as issues will have to be resolved manually which is time consuming and at times mentally draining. The AITS addresses this gap by providing a user-friendly platform that facilitates issue reporting and tracking, ensuring that students can easily communicate their concerns and receive timely feedback. Hence, the Academic Issue Tracking System (AITS) is designed to provide a streamlined platform for students at Makerere University to report and track academic issues, course-related concerns, and other academic challenges. This system aims to enhance communication between students and their faculties, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and effectively, ultimately improving the overall academic experience with it too being time saving and accurate.
Project Description
	The AITS will be a web-based application, accessible through a web browser without the need for users to install any software on their devices. This will ensure accessibility, flexibility and ease that users can access the system from anywhere with an internet connection, making it convenient for students and faculties to report and track issues at any time. The platform will include features like; -
•	User Registration and Authentication: Users (students, lecturers, and administrators) can create accounts and log in securely.
•	Issue Reporting: A user-friendly interface for students to submit issues related to their academic experience, including descriptions, categories (e.g., advising, resources, workload), and any relevant attachments.
•	Issue Tracking: Once an issue is reported, it gets a unique identifier and can be tracked through various stages (submitted, in review, resolved).
•	Notifications: Automated notifications are sent to users about the status of their reported issues, ensuring they are kept informed throughout the process.
•	Admin Dashboard: Administrators can view all reported issues, filter them by category, status, or department, and assign them to appropriate staff for resolution.
•	Reporting and Analytics: The system can generate reports on common issues, response times, and resolutions, helping the university identify trends and areas for improvement.
•	Feedback Mechanism: After resolution, users can provide feedback on how their issue was handled, which helps improve the system and processes.
Objectives  
	To create an efficient and accessible platform for students to report academic issues.
	To streamline communication between students and the faculties, reducing response times and improving issue resolution.
	To ensure that all reported issues are tracked and managed effectively, providing transparency to students, lecturers and administrators .
	The main goal of the system is to provide a centralized platform for reporting, tracking, and resolving academic issues.
Value proposition
	Efficiency: Streamlines the process of reporting and resolving academic issues, saving time for both students and lecturers.
	Accessibility: Provides a web-based platform that allows users to report issues anytime and anywhere, enhancing convenience.
	Transparency: Offers real-time tracking of reported issues, allowing users to stay informed about the status and resolution process.
	Improved Communication: Facilitates better communication between students, lecturers and administrators, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and effectively.
	Data-Driven Insights: Generates reports and analytics that help institutions identify trends in academic issues, leading to informed decision-making and proactive improvements.
	User-friendly interface, that enhances the overall experience for all users, making it easy to navigate and utilize the system.
This project can significantly contribute to creating a more supportive academic environment by ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently

Methodology:
The methodology for this project includes:
- Conducting issue assessment and requirements gathering exercises to identify the types of academic issues that affect students and lecturers at Makerere University
- Designing and prototyping the AITS using user-centered design principles and agile development methodologies
- Developing the AITS using a combination of open-source and proprietary software, including PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript
- Testing and evaluating the AITS using a combination of unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing
- Implementing the AITS and providing training and support to university staff and students

Timeline:
The project timeline is as follows:
- Needs assessment and requirements gathering: 2 weeks
- Design and prototyping: 2 weeks
